         <!-- Case study content -->
         <p>The app allows users to order food from a variety of delicious cuisine directly to their office, as
            well as provide a way to track their order(s) and suggest meal combinations. The business is
            specific about its audience, who are the working class citizens
            Most users complain about (assuming these were the challenges faced) how hard it is to
            navigate through the app(not memorable), bad user interface (inconsistent design), a complex
            checkout system and most especially not being able to track their orders.
            
            These are the UX/UI challenges that I have decided to improve on, along with an order tracking
            system, in this case study.
            
            For the sake of this study, Plated Cuisine would be used to describe the app which the chef is
            using to offer her services.</p>

                <p><b>Goals and Objectives:</b></p>
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>To improve and design a better food tracking experience</li>
                    <li>Mobile design approach</li>
                    <li>Minimal UI (modern and fresh)</li>
                    <li>Easy navigation throughout the app, fewer user action approach</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Understanding the problem</b></p>

                <p>The solution is to design an app for an emerging chef who wants to offer her food services to a
                    targeted audience (working-class people). My first step was to familiarise myself with Plated
                    Cuisine and the business process. From having an in-person interview with her at the office, I
                    learnt the following 9 to 5 Her business perspective, goals & objective
                    The core purpose of this app which is “Comfort at your office”</p>

                <p>After absorbing all the information, I was able to breakdown the project into modules — which
                    would enable me to pay close attention to even the minute details. The essence of this is to
                    equip me with the necessary information to use and provide a solution for the users</p>
            <p><b>Research and Analysis</b></p>

            <p>Now that I have a better understanding of the Plated Cuisine, I began my competitive analysis
                to see which companies/apps are currently dominating the market in the food delivery space,
                to understand their patterns and draw relevant findings such as:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Why are users currently using this app? Is it the brand image? Food quality?</li>
                <li>Current issues users are facing using these applications</li>
                <li>Specific issues relating to the food tracking system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After making my findings, I began to research on a global scale to see what’s new, keep in
                touch with the design styles and trends. With my focus being the improvement of the food
                delivery tracking system it has been seen through research why users abandon or cancel their
                orders based on some reoccurring issues like:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Price discrepancies, which makes the users unhappy</li>
                <li>Users confused about when and how long their food would get to them</li>
                <li>Dispatch riders not conversant with proper navigation systems like google, which leads to
                    unoptimised routes = unhappy customer</li>
                <li>Quality of food delivered (since most apps in question offer food services from different
                    vendors</li>
                <li>Complicated menus</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To get more insight I carried out a mini-survey which targeted the working class people (ages
                23–30), I needed more data on their day to day activities and how ordering food during their
                busy schedule affects their routines, this enabled me to arrive at relevant conclusions, below
                are my findings:</p>
                <div style="text-align: left;">
                    <img src="images\Case_Studies\Case 2\2.png" alt="Survey Findings" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;">
                    <p><b>Here are some of the relevant questions I asked and some feedbacks:</b></p>
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>What does your typical day look like?</li>
                        <li>Why do you use food delivery services? How many of them do you use?</li>
                        <li>What issues are you having with the current apps?</li>
                        <li>What could be a reason you would use our solution?</li>
                        <li>What’s your take on food quality?</li>
                        <li>How efficiently do the current food delivery services you use help you track your order?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>User Persona</b></p>

                    <p>Using the report from the survey and interview, I
                        created a user persona that embodies the traits of
                        the target audience. The user persona created helps
                        me get a better understanding of the problem I’m
                        trying to solve</p>
                        <div style="text-align: left;">
                            <img src="images\Case_Studies\Case 2\3.png" alt="User Persona" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;">
                        </div>
                        <p><b>User Flows</b></p>

                        <p>This process is all about defining the flow for plated
                            cuisine, bringing more insight to the layouts and
                            structure of the app. This helps to define the
                            navigation flow for the app, aimed at making the flow
                            and steps very easy, memorable for a user which
                            would increase interactiveness. A user (in this case
                            Zik) just has to register or log in once when using the
                            app for the first time.</p>

                        <p>The app has been structured in a way to reduce the
                            user actions to complete an order, 4 clicks are all it
                            takes to order a meal, which is very simple and
                            minimal.</p>
                            <div style="text-align: left;">
                                <img src="images\Case_Studies\Case 2\4.png" alt="User Flows" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;">
                            <p><b>User Storyboard and Sketches</b></p>

                            <p>Creating a storyboard and sketches for this case
                                study helped me emphasise with the user through
                                (Zik) his journey giving me a more defined contextual
                                idea and spot out challenges that may occur or user
                                needs not put into consideration.</p>

                            <p>After several iterations in the sketching process, I
                                was able to come up with a solution for a better food
                                tracking experience.</p>

                                <p><b>Wire framing</b></p>
                                <p>With the sketches above the goal was to provide a
                                    solution for the pain points uncovered in the initial
                                    research. This is a form of low-fidelity wire-framing
                                    which gave me a clearer picture of how the interface
                                    would look like, also covering the basic content
                                    structure.</p>

                                <p>During this process, I crafted out how each of the
                                    screens connects together to give a seamless and
                                    smoother experience.</p>

                                    <p><b>High fidelity & Prototyping</b></p>
                                    <p>Using all the information gotten from the above sketches, user flow and wireframes I was able
                                        to convert them into a high-fidelity visual representation of the app. By using cool and neutral
                                        colours I was able to come up with a fresh & minimal design.</p>

                                    <p><b>Ordering food</b></p>

                                    <p>When a first-time user launches the app, a splash screen would be displayed which then
                                        redirects the user to the signup page. After the registration process, the user is directed to the
                                        home page where orders from a variety of delicacies can be made.</p>

                                    <p>From the home screen, users can choose a dish of their choice, also a user can add sides or
                                        drinks to complement their meal from a single screen. Users can also choose between dark and
                                        light mode depending on their mood. Also, at the point of checkout users can decide to
                                        add more dishes to their order(s).</p>
                                    <p>Depending on the time of the day the app suggests different meal options to the user to make
                                        the selection better.
                                        
                                        Users can set up specific meals they want to be ordering frequently. When a first time user
                                        launches the app he/she can click on custom which would display a full menu encouraging
                                        them to select the combos they want. This would make the ordering process faster and
                                        simpler.
                                        
                                        If a user wants to have more details on the food he/she wants to order, by sliding right on the
                                        food selection page (3rd screen from the left) a user can view the ingredients used to make the
                                        meal</p>

                                        <p>After research and feedback gotten from users, I was able to come up with a much simpler and
                                            user-friendly tracking solution (So Zik can have his meetings in peace). After placing an order a
                                            confirmation screen shows giving the option for a user to track an order. When a user clicks
                                            “Track my order” button a screen that shows the order progress displays, giving the user an
                                            idea as of when the order would be completed.
                                            
                                            When an order is dispatched, the user would be notified and has the option to track the rider’s
                                            movements, also a user can update their current location. When tracking the rider’s
                                            movements the user has an option to call.
