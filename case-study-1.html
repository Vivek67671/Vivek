        <p>The problem involved designing the flow for the user to buy multiple variants of a product
            which has staggered pricing and at the same time ensuring that she is making a good deal (i.e.
            <b>Value for money).Duration: 2 weeks

            Tools: Sketch, Zeplin, Marvel</b>I followed the Double Diamond approach for the
            project. We started by gathering data from PMs and
            business teams and did a competitive study to
            better understand the problem. Then we narrowed
            down the data to some of the key problems/
            constraints we need to address while designing.
            After that, we explored multiple solutions for
            solving these problems, and finally, we narrowed
            down to a final solution.</p>

            <p><b>Gathering Data</b></p>
            <p>Variants and Staggered Pricing</p>

            <p>Before starting with the design
            process, it was necessary to
            understand the variants and
            their pricing model.</p>
            <p>If service price(Sp) is dependent
            on time(t) and material used(m),
            then for different value of t and
            m, S would have different values.</p>
            
            <p>This is called a staggered pricing
            model and each value of the
            price(S) is called a variant.</p>
            
            <p>In our case, We wanted to solve
            for the Massage category and
            Massage was available for two
            durations: 60 and 90 min.</p>
            <p>For these two time values, the service price was not a linear function of time. The price(y) for
            90 min massage was lesser than what it would be for a linear pricing model (y<1.5x; x=price for
            60 min massage). Thus, A higher variant type was available for a discounted price which makes
            it a value for money deal for the user. Through our design, we wanted to entice her into buying
            <b>this high price variant.</b></p>

            <p><b>Understanding Variant Flow and Business Requirements</b></p> <p>For understanding the variant flow, I first looked at how UrbanClap app was dealing with the
                problem of variants earlier. I found out that there were separate SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit) for
                each variant type which was increasing the scroll length of the page. Thus, we wanted to
                eliminate the need of having separate SKUs</p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%; text-align: left;">
                <img src="images/Case_Studies/image 11.png" alt="Variant Flow" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover;">
            </div>

            <p>Also, the goal of this project was to scale the variant flow to other categories too. For this, I
                talked with different category heads to understand the various requirements. e.g. for some of
                the variant types, the only short heading wouldn t suffice and we needed some description of
                the variant along with the heading while for some other cases, we needed pictures also.</p>

            <p>There was also a limit to the number of items a user could buy for a variant type. For some
                cases, we needed to give the ability to the user to buy multiple quantities of a variant type
                while for some cases, she could buy only one.</p>

            <p><b>Defining the Problem</b></p>
            <p>After gathering data and understanding the requirements, we formulated a set of problems we needed to consider while designing. We did this using the “How might we method in which each problem is converted to a “How might we question</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>How might we up-sell the higher variant to the user and at the same time ensure that she is making a good deal?</li>
                <li>How might we give an ability to the user to view all variants associated with the product/SKU and add them to the cart without going into the details page?</li>
                <li>How might we make it scalable so that the same design can be extended to other categories?</li>
                <li>How might we give the user the ability to buy multiple quantities of A type and B type of same variants in one go?</li>
                <li>How might we inform the user that she has already selected multiple variants of an SKU without going further into the flow?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>Ideating and Brainstorming</b></p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%; text-align: left;">

            </div><p>We started sketching the various solution possible for variant flow and
                tried to figure out how the SKU card could inform the user that multiple
                variants were available for the product.
                
                For the SKU card, we had to make decisions for
                
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%; text-align: left;">

                <br>
                <p><b>1. How to up sell higher price variant over other?</b></p>
                <p>Since the pricing was not linear, We thought of showing a table for price comparison of all the
                    variants on the card itself and showing the benefits of buying higher value variant by showing
                    the savings on that variant. This solution was good for a service where only 2 variants were
                    available but increasing the variants would increase the length of the card and thus have
                    increased the scrolling length. To avoid this, we thought of making the list items horizontally
                    scrollable on the card. But this would hide the best price available for the service and it would
                    become difficult to show description along with each variant.
                    
                    We also thought of adding an offer tag in the card to inform the user that they could make a
                    good deal out of the standard price by spending some extra bucks and placed it close to
                    variant selection button so that it is easier for the user to take action (of changing variant).</p>

                <p><b>Details</b> -  Since we were selling a service, only title and image wouldn t suffice the information
                    needed to sell the service. Therefore we added some pointers(e.g. benefits, pressure points,
                    oils used for massage, etc.) to help the user to make the decision easier without going into the
                    Details page.
                    <br>
                    <b>Price</b> -  Deciding what price to be shown upfront was the most difficult challenge. e.g. We
                    thought of showing price range as Amazon does it for variants. But the price range was not a
                    clear indicator of the price for an item as for some category (like Bathroom cleaning) where
                    bulk purchase model (the more you buy, the more discount you get) is followed, the price of a
                    single item may be less than what is shown by the minimum of the range.

                        e.g. I thought of showing only the standard price on the card and then writing the different
                        variants available in the plain text. Then my VP told me that we needed to highlight the offer
                        associated with variant informing that the user could make a better deal by spending some                        <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%; text-align: left;">
